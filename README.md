# Wormageddon

> A dead-simple, zero-install **worm-sign & threat-level tuner** for a self-hosted
> **Dune: Awakening** dedicated server.

Drag a few sliders, hit **APPLY + RESTART**, and the desert gets scarier (or
calmer). Wormageddon edits the persistent `UserGame.ini` overrides on your Dune
server over SSH and restarts the affected shard so the change takes effect — no
agent to install on the server, no service to host, no database to wire up. Just
two PowerShell files on your Windows box.

It is laser-focused on the dials that make sandworms and the world *feel*
different: how aggressively worms hunt you, how much "threat" each action
generates, how dense the worms are, when the giant **Shai-Hulud** erupts, plus a
handful of storm / harvest / day-length knobs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Unofficial fan tool.** Wormageddon is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
> supported by Funcom. "Dune: Awakening" and "Shai-Hulud" are trademarks of
> their respective owners. It edits live server config and **restarts shards
> (dropping players on them)** — read [docs/SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) first and
> use at your own risk.

## Why this exists

The big community admin tools — [adainrivers/dune-dedicated-server-manager](https://github.com/adainrivers/dune-dedicated-server-manager)
(server lifecycle + in-game admin) and [Icehunter/dune-admin](https://github.com/Icehunter/dune-admin)
(a full multi-provider web panel) — are excellent and do *far* more than this
project. Wormageddon deliberately does **one thing**: it makes tuning *worm sign
and threat* trivial, with curated presets and zero setup, for a single operator
on Windows. If you want a full control plane, use one of those. If you just want
to make the worms terrifying before tonight's session, you're in the right place.

See the honest, detailed three-way breakdown in [docs/COMPARISON.md](docs/COMPARISON.md).

## How it works

There is **no game API** for these settings. They are Unreal Engine 5 `*.ini`
overrides that the server reads when a shard starts. So the entire trick is:

```
 Your Windows PC                         Dune server VM (Alpine + k3s)
 ┌───────────────────┐   SSH (key)   ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ Wormageddon-GUI   │ ────────────▶ │  sudo k3s kubectl exec <shard pod> ...  │
 │   (sliders)       │               │     │                                   │
 │ Wormageddon.ps1   │               │     ├─ back up UserGame.ini             │
 │   (CLI engine)    │               │     ├─ merge your change into it        │
 └───────────────────┘               │     └─ delete the pod  → shard restarts │
                                      │        (re-reads UserGame.ini on boot)  │
                                      └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **SSH** to the Dune VM using the key the Dune Dedicated Server Manager already
   generated for you.
2. **`kubectl exec`** into the running shard pod and edit
   `…/DuneSandbox/Saved/UserSettings/UserGame.ini` (a timestamped backup is
   written to `.\backups` first, every time).
3. **Restart that one shard** so the server re-reads the file.

Full details in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Sandworms repopulate ~10 minutes after *any* restart.** "No worms right
> after a restart" is normal — use the GUI's **Worms?** button (or
> `Wormageddon.ps1 worms`) to check warm-up.

## Requirements

- **Windows** with PowerShell **5.1+** (built in) — and the OpenSSH client
  (`ssh.exe`, built into Windows 10/11). Password auth instead of a key needs
  [PuTTY/plink](https://www.putty.org); a key is strongly recommended.
- A **Dune: Awakening dedicated server** on the Funcom `igw` platform (Alpine +
  single-node k3s) — the kind the
  [Dune Dedicated Server Manager](https://github.com/adainrivers/dune-dedicated-server-manager)
  provisions — reachable from your PC over SSH, with the game user able to run
  `sudo k3s kubectl`.

---

## Quick start

```bat
git clone https://github.com/SetsuaD/DuneAwakening-Wormageddon.git
cd DuneAwakening-Wormageddon
setup.bat        ::  seeds dune-connection.json + a Desktop shortcut
run_dev.bat      ::  opens the GUI
```

In the GUI: **Connect to Server** (enter your server IP, SSH user `dune`, and
your SSH key file) → pick a **shard** → **Read current** (or load a **Preset**)
→ drag sliders → **APPLY + RESTART**.

Prefer the command line? Everything the GUI does is available headless:

```powershell
# show current overrides on the survival shard
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Wormageddon.ps1 show

# crank the worms, then apply
.\Wormageddon.ps1 preset wormageddon
.\Wormageddon.ps1 restart -Shard Survival_1 -Yes

# or tune a single dial
.\Wormageddon.ps1 set Sandworm ThreatScale 2.0
.\Wormageddon.ps1 restart
```

## CLI reference

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `status` | Shards + players (Funcom serverstats) |
| `shards` | List the running map/shard names |
| `worms [-Shard S]` | Sandworm spawn count + shard uptime (warm-up check) |
| `show [-Shard S]` | Print the shard's current `UserGame.ini` overrides |
| `get <Key> [-Shard S]` | Show the game default **and** current override for a key |
| `set <Group> <Key> <Value> [-Shard S]` | Add/replace one override (merges; auto-backup) |
| `unset <Group> <Key> [-Shard S]` | Remove one override (revert that key to default) |
| `preset <Name> [-Shard S]` | Apply a curated bundle from `presets.json` (auto-backup) |
| `backup [-Shard S]` | Save a timestamped copy of `UserGame.ini` to `.\backups` |
| `restart [-Shard S] [-Yes]` | Restart one shard so pending changes take effect |
| `ssh "<cmd>"` | Run a raw shell command on the VM (advanced/debug) |

**Groups** map to UE5 ini sections: `Sandworm`, `TimeOfDay`, `Building`,
`GameMode`, `Pvp`, `Security`, `Storm`, `Harvest`, `FlourSand`, `Hydration`
(or pass a full `/Script/...` section name).

## The dials (worm sign & threat highlights)

These live in the **Sandworm** group (`[/Script/DuneSandbox.SandwormSettings]`).
Full table of every setting — storms, harvest, day length, hydration, PvP drop —
is in [docs/SETTINGS_REFERENCE.md](docs/SETTINGS_REFERENCE.md).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---:|---|
| `ThreatScale` | 1.0 | **Master multiplier on all worm threat.** The single biggest dial. |
| `DefaultMaxThreatScore` | 5000 | Threat that must build before a worm commits to attack. Lower = strikes sooner. |
| `WalkingThreatPerSec` | 15 | "Worm sign" generated per second while walking… |
| `SprintingThreatPerSec` | 20 | …sprinting… |
| `DashingThreatPerSec` | 90 | …dashing (a sharp spike)… |
| `ShieldingThreatPerSec` | 500 | …and with a Holtzman shield up on foot (a worm magnet). |
| `m_MinDistanceBetweenSandworms` | 80000 | Worm spacing (cm). Lower = denser worm population. |
| `m_bGiantWormSystemEnabled` | On | Master toggle for the scripted giant worm (Shai-Hulud). |
| `m_GiantWormMinimumPlayersOnSpiceField` | 4 | Harvesters needed to trigger Shai-Hulud. `1` = anyone can summon it. |

### Presets (`presets.json`)

| Preset | Vibe |
|---|---|
| `calm` | Relaxed worms — sparse, slow to provoke, forgiving. |
| `standard` | The game's default worm behaviour. |
| `wormageddon` | Maximum threat — dense, hair-trigger, summonable giant worm. |

Presets are plain JSON; copy a block to make your own. There's also a one-click
**SUMMON SHAI-HULUD** button in the GUI that makes the giant worm callable on
demand by a single spice harvester.

---

## Safety

- Every `set`/`unset`/`preset` writes a **timestamped backup** of `UserGame.ini`
  to `.\backups` before changing anything.
- **A restart drops the players on that shard** (~1 minute). Use an empty window
  or warn them. The CLI asks for confirmation unless you pass `-Yes`.
- `dune-connection.json` (your server IP, key path, optional password) is
  **git-ignored** — it never leaves your PC.

More in [docs/SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md).

- Built for servers provisioned by **[adainrivers/dune-dedicated-server-manager](https://github.com/adainrivers/dune-dedicated-server-manager)**.
- The broader, more capable community web panel is **[Icehunter/dune-admin](https://github.com/Icehunter/dune-admin)** — worth a look if you outgrow this.
